        <li>100 ml vegan red wine</li>
        <li>400 g (1 can) chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>200 g strained tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>0..5 tsp paprika powder</li>
        <li>Neutral vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>vegan lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>vegan sprinkled cheese (optional)</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the bechamel sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp vegan butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp wheat flour</li>
        <li>250 ml plant-based milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp yeast flakes</li>
        <li>nutmeg</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Preparation:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the tomato "mince" layer, peel and finely dice the onion. Coarsely grate the carrots or cut into small
            cubes.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat and fry the vegan mince for approx. 5 minutes until
            browned. Add the onion and carrot to the pan and fry everything together for 4-5 minutes. Then add the
            tomato purée, soy sauce and agave syrup and heat for approx. 3 minutes so that the tomato purée darkens
            slightly.</li>
        <li>Deglaze with red wine and simmer for about 5 minutes. Then add the chopped and strained tomatoes, ketchup,
            dried basil, oregano, cayenne pepper and paprika powder and mix well. Season the sauce with salt and pepper
            and simmer over a low heat until the vegan bechamel is ready.</li>
        <li>To make the bechamel, melt the vegan butter in a small pan. Then stir in the flour and sweat for approx. 1
            minute over a low heat. Slowly add the plant-based milk and stir in thoroughly so that no lumps form. Season
            the bechamel with yeast flakes, salt, pepper and nutmeg. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more
            plant-based milk.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 °C (fan oven). First spread a thin layer of the tomato and mince sauce in a baking
            dish. Place the vegan lasagne sheets on top and cover with another layer of the tomato and mince sauce.
            Spread some of the vegan bechamel sauce on top and place a second layer of lasagne sheets on top. Repeat the
            layers until all the ingredients have been used up. Then spread a final layer of vegan bechamel on top.
            Optionally, mix the vegan sprinkled cheese with a little vegetable oil and water and spread over the
            casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagne at 180 °C for approx. 40 minutes until the lasagne sheets are soft and the vegan cheese
            layer is golden brown. Then remove from the oven and leave the lasagne to stand for a few minutes to cool
            and firm up before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
