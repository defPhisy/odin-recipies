# odin-recipes
First steps in HTML and GIT with a recipe website without CSS:

* After creating a new repo i cloned it onto my pc via ssh
* created new index.html with boilerplate code and first heading
* committed this to git locally
* added folder recipes with 3 different recipe sites with unordered and ordered lists. Images of the meals were also added.
* linked alle these recipes in an unordered list on the index.html
* during the process i made several git commits. some git adds i had to un-stage and postpone for later commits to get clearer commits to focus on one or two things only making the commit more "atomic"
